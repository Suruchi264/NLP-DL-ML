## Machine Learning Algorithms



Iâ€™ve built a comprehensive GitHub repository covering core Machine Learning algorithms with clean, reproducible implementations in Jupyter Notebooks â€” perfect for showcasing end-to-end understanding from data prep to model evaluation for real-world roles in data science, analytics, and ML engineering. Note: The repository is organized as individual notebooks grouped by algorithms and topics like classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and project scaffolding/logging.

ðŸ“‚ Organized By:
A) Classification: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost â€” with scaling, hyperparameter tuning, decision boundaries, feature importance, and metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC).

B) Regression: Linear, Multiple, Polynomial, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost â€” with interpretability, bias-variance control, and RMSE/MAE/RÂ² evaluation.
C) Clustering: K-Means (Elbow/Silhouette), Hierarchical (Dendrograms), DBSCAN â€” with scaling, visualization, and cluster profiling.
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA with variance retention and component analysis.
D) Extras:
Centralized model training pipeline with reproducible experiments.
Logging & Multi-Logger setups for production-grade ML.
SQLite integration for lightweight persistence.
Ethical web scraping for dataset creation.
Parallel processing for faster feature engineering.
Memory optimization techniques for large datasets.
End-to-end EDA & feature engineering with before/after performance comparison.
